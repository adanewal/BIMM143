## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## The PDB database for biomolecular srtucutre data 

Q1. Determine the percentage of PDB strucutre solved by X-ray and EM. Determine what proportion of structures are protein?

Download CSV file from PDB website
```{r}
#read CSV
data <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
data
```

Total number of entries and then finding proportion of entries from each method
```{r}
sum(data$Total)
total <- sum(data$Total)
round((data$Total/total) * 100 , 2)

```

Proportion that are protein
```{r}
round((sum(data$Proteins)/total) * 100 , 2)
```


##HIV-Pr strucutre analysis 
Here we will read the 1HSG PDB structure and select the protein component and write out a new protein-only PDB format file. We then do the same for the ligand (i.e. known drug molecule) creating a ligand-only PDB file 

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg.pdb")
pdb
#read.pdb()
#atom.select()
#write.pdb()
#trim.pdb()
```

```{r}
ligand <- atom.select(pdb,"protein", value=TRUE)
write.pdb(ligand, file="1hsg_ligand.pdb")
```
