## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
source("http://tinyurl.com/rescale-R")
```

```{r}
rescale( c(11,10,5,NA,6))
```

```{r}
#rescale2(c(1:10, "barry"))
```

```{r}
#rescale(c(1:10, "barry"))
```

##A new function called **is.na()** 
Write a function to find where there are NA elements in two input vectors 
First make some simple input where I know the answer

```{r}
x <- c(1,2,NA,3,NA)
y <- c(NA,3,NA,3,4)
```

Looked online and found **is.na()** function
```{r}
is.na(x)
is.na(y)
```

and the **which()** function tells me where the TRUE values are 
```{r}
which(is.na(x))
which(is.na(y))
```

The AND function required two input TRUE to give a TRUE output 
```{r}
is.na(x) & is.na(y)
```

Taking the **sum()** of TRUE FALSE vector will tell me how many TRUE elements I have 
```{r}
sum(is.na(x) & is.na(y))
```
This is a working snippet!!
```{r}
sum(c(TRUE,TRUE, FALSE, TRUE))
```

Now turn it into a function 
```{r}
both_na <- function (x,y) {
  sum(is.na(x) & is.na(y))
}
```

```{r}
both_na (x,y)
```

```{r}
x <- c(NA, NA, NA)
y1 <- c( 1, NA, NA)
y2 <- c( 1, NA, NA, NA)
```

```{r}
both_na(x, y1)
```

```{r}
both_na(x, y2)
```

```{r}
x2 <- c(NA,NA)
both_na(x2,y2)
```

Remember this function recyles the value to fit the greatest 
```{r}
plot(1:10, col=c("red","blue","green"))
```

Using the same idea here, we should get 6 as the answer 
```{r}
x <- c(1, NA, NA)
y3 <- c( 1, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)
both_na(x,y3)
```

```{r}
x3 <- c(1, NA, NA, 1, NA, NA, 1)
y3 <- c( 1, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)
both_na(x3, y3)
```

```{r}
length(x)
length(y3)
```

Add a check for when inputs x and y are not the same length 
```{r}
both_na2 <- function (x,y) {
  if(length(x) != length(y)) {
    stop("Inputs x and y should be the same length")
  }
  sum(is.na(x) & is.na(y))
}
```

```{r}
#both_na2 (x,y3)
```

##Assignment 10/22
Write a function grade() to determnine an overall grade from a vector of student homework assignment scores dropping the lowest single aligment score 

```{r}
# student 1
s1 <- c(100,100,100,100,100,100,100,90)
# student 2
s2 <- c(100,NA,90,90,90,90,97,80)
```

 looked online and found **which()** function thatfinds the minimum values 
```{r}
which.min(s1)
```

this is not a useful way to find the value, instead we can show all values except the min.
```{r}
s1[-which.min(s1)]
```

now to find the mean of the student1 vector 
```{r}
mean(s1[-which.min(s1)])
```

now running the same thing on student2 vector = but this doesn't work because apparently the student failed
```{r}
mean(s2[-which.min(s2)])
```

need to drop the NA score and then average out the rest of the test scores
```{r}
which.min(s2)
s2[-which.min(s2)]
mean(s2[-which.min(s2)], na.rm = TRUE)
```

```{r}
is.na(s2)
any(is.na(s2))
any(is.na(s1))
```


We have a working code now, so turning it into the first function 
```{r}
grade <- function(x) {
  if(any(is.na(x)) ) {
    warning("!!Student is missing a homework!!")
  }
  mean(x[-which.min(x)], na.rm=TRUE)
}
```

```{r}
grade(s1)
grade(s2)
```

we could have put stop instead of warning but its not fair if a student has all NAs and one 100 he gets 100 which is unfair 
```{r}
grade2 <- function(x) {
  if(any(is.na(x)) ) {
    warning("!!Student is missing a homework!!")
  }
  sum(x[-which.min(x)], na.rm=TRUE)/ (length(x)-1)
}
```

```{r}
s3 <- c(100, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)
grade2(s3)
```

##Now grading the entire class dataset 
```{r}
url <- "http://tinyurl.com/gradeinput"
hw <- read.csv(url, row.names=1)
apply(hw, 1, grade)
```
